# Simple-Java-Network-Scanner
This is a simple Java software I wrote during my free time, it basically scans all IPs on a connected network, then displays the IP address, computer name, and OS. It also has a export to log file option. Note that there are some swing GUI bugs, however they are very minimal and don't affect function. Functions as expected.

Requirements: [Java JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk19-windows)

**Note: The source .java file is for NetworkScanner.jar, and not the patched version. The patched version fixes package and a module name, allowing me to build with no issues and actually allowing me to get this working on one of my other devices. Code for NetworkScannerPatched.jar will be up soon, despite it being almost exactly identical.**
