# Simple-Java-Network-Scanner
This is a simple Java software I wrote during my free time, it basically scans all IPs on a connected network, then displays the IP address, computer name, and OS. It also has a export to log file option. Note that there are some swing GUI bugs, note that I am only 13 and only a intermediate.

**You can find the compiled jar (Java Executable) here:** [NetworkScanner.jar - URL](https://github.com/TheGameCenter/Simple-Java-Network-Scanner/blob/main/bin/Builds/NetworkScanner.jar)
